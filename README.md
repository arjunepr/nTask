# nTask

This is basically a simple API with its data being consumed by React.js on the front end. I'm making this for mainly four reasons.

1. To learn to build APIs.
2. To get better at React.
3. To develop best practicies for myself.
4. To have a backend project to show in my portfolio.

The code is completely free and open source so feel free to use for whatever purpose you see fit.
